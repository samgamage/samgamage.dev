As the React ecosystem moves more towards using functional components, I can't
help but look back on what React looked like when I first started learning it
and how it has changed since then.

I first started learning react in 2018 right when version 16.6 came out. This
was when `React.memo()` and `React.lazy()` first get introducted which was one
of the biggest changes to the core react library in a long time.

Having been a beginner I had a ton of questions as I was writing my first few
React components. Questions like:

- How does my class component get called?
- Why do I have to call `super()` on the components props in the constructor?
- What's the difference between the PureComponent class and the Component class?
- How do I know when to use PureComponent or Component?
- Why are there so many life-cycle methods?!?
- Why do I have to keep writing the same logic over and over again? Isn't there
  a better way to do this?

I found myself constantly asking these questions very frequently and for good
reason to. I would often have to read parts of documentation over and over to
fully grasp some concepts in class components.

Maybe it was because I had not been exposed to much object-oriented programming
but class components just didn't click for me in the beginning.

## Enter React Hooks

When I first heard that the React core team was introducing a functional API for
creating React hooks I was _very interested_.

No longer would I have to scratch my head on whether to use `this` or why I need
to use PureComponent for this component and Component for another one. No longer
would I have to rewrite the same form state functionality 5 times in the same
app!

Hooks provide for a functional way of creating and updating state through the
`useState()` function. This function is rather interesting because it returned
an array of values. At first I was a bit confused by this and questioned why the
developers decided to implement it this way. The reason why it returnes an array
is because it needs to return two things: the state and a function to update it.
Take a look at this simple example:

```js {1, 4} index.jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Component = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(1);

  return <div>{state}</div>;
};
```

Two things to note here:

1. I am getting the useState function from React as a destructured import.
2. I can grab the first two elements returned by `useState` by destructuring the
   array it returns.

This convention for defining and updating state is very versatile. In fact, I
can use the `useState` function in any function that I define even ones that
don't render jsx.

This means I can create my own "helper functions" to reuse state logic! This
concept is something that the React devs thought about and gave it the name
"hook" because we are "hooking" into the react state.

### Simplicity

One of the things I enjoy about React hooks is how simple and readable they are.

The best way to showcase the simplicity of React hooks is to write out
components in both hooks and classes.

Lets say I want to have a counter component which stores and updates a count
state.

The class component version would look like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0
    };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState(prevState => ({ counter: prevState.counter + 1 }));
  };

  decrement = () => {
    this.setState(prevState => ({ counter: prevState.counter - 1 }));
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.state.counter}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

As we saw before, the hooks version would look something like this:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{counter}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Not only is the hooks version shorter but it is also more readable. Being able
to directly access both the state and an updater function takes a lot of the
grudge out of writing React components.

### Optimizing React Components and useEffect

I'll admit, I was not always that great at seeing when a component should be
pure or default. To put it lightly, pure components are components which are
components that only re-render when either the state or props change. More often
than not pure components end up towards the bottom of the react tree.

React 16.8 is the first version to fully introduce a functional API along with a
plethora of hooks that the React team developed like `useState` and `useRef`.
One of the more notable ones is `useEffect` because of how versatile it is. The
way `useEffect` works is dead simple. It only fires the function when of the
dependencies in the dependency array changes.

Let's take a look at an example. I'll use some of the same code from before:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Counter changed!");
  }, [counter]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{counter}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

As you can see useEffect takes two parameters: a callback function and a
dependecy array. Now you might be asking... what about componentDidMount? How do
I repliacte this functionality in React hooks?

Well, in order to mock the equivalent componentDidMount function all we have to
do is leave the dependency array empty. I should note that even though we have
specified an element in the dependency array, it will still fire on the intitial
mount because the initial state is being set during this time.

From traditional class components a conditional effect that does the same logic
might look something like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0
    };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState(prevState => ({ counter: prevState.counter + 1 }));
  };

  decrement = () => {
    this.setState(prevState => ({ counter: prevState.counter - 1 }));
  };

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    if (this.counter !== nextState.counter) {
      console.log("Counter changed!");
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.state.counter}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Again, not only is this code longer but it is also a relatively simple effect
that takes a ton of code to execute. The `useEffect` hook takes out all of the
confusion in conditional effects and simplifies reactive programming
significantly.

### Reusable Logic

One of the best things that React hooks offers to the table besides dead simple
API's is the ability to reuse state and effect logic in custom hooks.

Let's say that I was using the same counter logic in different parts of my React
application. Instead of writing the same `useState` and `useEffect` functions
over and over we can instead create a hook that encapsulates the logic.

```jsx
const useCounter = initialState => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Counter changed!");
  }, [counter]);

  return [counter, setCounter];
};
```

This hook can now be used in other components like so:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useCounter(0);

  return <div>{counter}</div>;
};
```

Nice. Not only is this code clean and easy to use but its also scalable. We can
easily add more effects to our useCounter hook that will change the effects of
all the components which use it. No more copying and pasting the same logic.

In addition there is a thriving community behind open sourcing useful React
hooks. I would encourage you check out these links for some awesome open-source
hooks:

## In Conclusion

I think that hooks was once of the best additions the React team could've done.
Not only does it make functional reactive programming simple and intuitive, but
it lesses the amount of overhaul that beginners need to face when first stating
out in React. While there are still things that beginners should keep in mind,
many of the complexities have been abstracted away which has its benefits and
losses.

I'm excited to see where React hooks take the future of React and can't wait to
see the next thing that the React core team put out.
