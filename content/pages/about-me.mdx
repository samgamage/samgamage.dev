I am an Atlanta-based software developer and student attending the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) studying Computer Science (CS). My major is focused on studying AI and different applications of CS in media, such as chatbots, visualizations, and video games.

I am looking to pursue a career in software development building systems which can impact peoples everyday lives for the better using modern technology.

I am currently employed with [Data Fusion Specialists](https://www.datafusionspecialists.com) where I have been working on their corporate website and [Coeus AI Assistant](/projects/dfs-coeus-ai-assistant), a text and voice assistant built on top of assistants like IBM's Watson Assistant that can be integrated into complex business environments.

Interested in hiring me? Here is my resume. You can contact me at sgamage3@gatech.edu.
